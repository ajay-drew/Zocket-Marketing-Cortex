# Cursor Rules for Zocket Marketing Cortex Project

## CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

### Documentation Files (MD)
**IMPORTANT:** 
- **DO NOT** create unnecessary MD files
- **IF** you must create an MD file, it **MUST BE UNDER 100 LINES**
- **NEVER** create multiple MD files for the same information
- **ONLY** create MD files when explicitly requested by the user
- Keep documentation concise and consolidated
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new ones

### Why This Matters
- Users don't have time to read 10+ documentation files
- Multiple redundant files waste time and space
- Keep it simple and practical

## Project Context
This is the Marketing Cortex (ZMC) - a production-grade multi-agent AI system for Zocket's ad tech ecosystem. This project is critical for securing a full-time AI Agent Developer position at Zocket.

## Development History

### Session 1 - February 4, 2026
**User Request:** Create a comprehensive 250+ line reference document mapping the Marketing Cortex project to the AI Agent Developer job description and assessment criteria.

**Execution:**
1. **Analyzed Project Requirements:**
   - Reviewed attached PDFs (job description and assessment criteria)
   - Studied the detailed project plan provided by user
   - Identified key alignment points between project and role requirements

2. **Created PROJECT_REFERENCE.md:**
   - **Structure:** 10 main sections with detailed subsections
   - **Length:** 700+ lines (exceeding 250-line requirement)
   - **Content Sections:**
     - Executive Summary
     - Job Description Alignment (5 core responsibilities)
     - Assessment Criteria Mapping (5 key criteria)
     - Architecture Overview (with ASCII diagram)
     - Technical Stack & Justification
     - Implementation Phases (4 phases, 4-6 weeks)
     - Key Deliverables (6 major outputs)
     - Evaluation Metrics (agent performance + system reliability)
     - Integration with Zocket Products (Creative Studio, Snoop AI)
     - Risk Mitigation (technical + project risks)

3. **Key Features of Document:**
   - **Comprehensive Mapping:** Every JD requirement mapped to project implementation
   - **Evidence-Based:** Code references for each claim (e.g., `src/agents/supervisor.py`)
   - **Metrics-Driven:** Specific targets for success (>90% accuracy, <10s latency)
   - **Production-Focused:** Emphasis on deployment, monitoring, evaluation
   - **Zocket-Aligned:** Direct integration points with existing products

4. **Technical Decisions:**
   - Used markdown format for readability and version control
   - Included tables for structured comparisons
   - Added ASCII architecture diagram for visual clarity
   - Referenced specific file paths (even though not yet created) to guide implementation
   - Structured as both reference doc and implementation guide

## Project Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
- **Modularity:** Each agent is a separate, testable component
- **Observability:** All agent actions traced via LangSmith
- **Evaluation-First:** Metrics computed for every response
- **Production-Ready:** Error handling, caching, rate limiting from day one

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.10+, FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain
- **Databases:** Neo4j (graph), Pinecone (vector), Redis (cache), Zep (memory)
- **Observability:** LangSmith, Langfuse
- **Deployment:** Render (backend + frontend)
- **Frontend:** React/Vue with WebSocket streaming

### Code Organization
```
src/
├── agents/           # Supervisor + specialized agents
├── knowledge/        # Graph RAG + vector store
├── integrations/     # External APIs (Tavily, Ads APIs)
├── observability/    # LangSmith + Langfuse config
├── evaluation/       # Metrics and evaluation suite
├── api/              # FastAPI routes
└── core/             # Shared utilities (memory, cache)
```

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Foundation - Neo4j, Zep, FastAPI skeleton
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 2-3):** Agent development - 4 agents + orchestration
3. **Phase 3 (Week 4):** Enhancement - observability, evaluation, feedback loops
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 5-6):** Frontend, deployment, documentation

### Success Metrics
- Intent classification accuracy: >90%
- Task success rate: >85%
- Relevance score: >4/5
- Hallucination rate: <5%
- Latency (P95): <10s
- Uptime: >99%

## Future Interactions

### When Adding Features
- Update PROJECT_REFERENCE.md with new capabilities
- Map to JD requirements if applicable
- Add evaluation metrics for new features

### When Fixing Bugs
- Document root cause and fix in commit message
- Update risk mitigation section if new risk identified

### When Deploying
- Update deployment section with actual URLs and configs
- Document any deviations from planned architecture

## Notes
- This project is for a full-time position - prioritize production quality over speed
- All claims in PROJECT_REFERENCE.md should be backed by actual implementation
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes

### Session 2 - February 4, 2026 (Continued)
**User Request:** Update line count in PROJECT_REFERENCE.md and create a concise 250-line reference document with all phases included.

**Execution:**
1. **Updated PROJECT_REFERENCE.md:**
   - Changed "Total Lines: 700+" to "Total Lines: 742" for accuracy
   - Kept full comprehensive documentation intact

2. **Created QUICK_REFERENCE.md (250 lines):**
   - **Purpose:** Concise reference for quick consultation during implementation
   - **Structure:**
     - Project overview with architecture diagram
     - Technology stack table
     - All 4 implementation phases with tasks, deliverables, and success metrics
     - Evaluation metrics tables
     - Zocket product integration endpoints
     - Risk mitigation strategies
     - Success criteria checklist
     - Project structure tree
     - Week-by-week quick start checklist
   - **Key Features:**
     - Exactly 250 lines (as requested)
     - Includes all phases with specific details
     - Action-oriented with checkboxes
     - Easy to scan and reference during development
     - Links to full PROJECT_REFERENCE.md for deep dives

3. **Documentation Strategy:**
   - **PROJECT_REFERENCE.md (742 lines):** Comprehensive guide for understanding and justifying the project
   - **QUICK_REFERENCE.md (250 lines):** Practical guide for day-to-day implementation
   - Both documents complement each other for different use cases
